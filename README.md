# **Tribute Page to Diesel the Dinosaur**:

Diesel the Dinosaur was created as a character to engage young children with battery chemistry. I found immediate joy in becoming Diesel the Dinosaur. The reacations of children and adults alike are incredibly heartwarming. 

Desipite a the number of public interactions being limited by lockdown last year, a few *moments* of Diesel's life during lockdown were captured and published on Twitter to make people smile. 

## *Reflections*:
- I enjoy things much more when I have a bit of creative freedom.
- Having fun along the way is important.
- Code makes sense!
- Formatting is super important for readability.
